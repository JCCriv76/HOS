Executive Summary:  HOS (Health of the Squadron) is an analytic model of an Air Force squadon's operational tempo. It presents a snapshot of organizational capacity and assists leaders with balancing surge requirements (beyond specified tasking through the Global Force Management process) and aircrew experience. HOS describes how the relationship between personnel and battle rhythm affects capacity by using the ratio of deploy-to-dwell time (time spent overseas vs. time spent stateside) for comparison.

Source Information: Data was collected during 2015-2016 from the Patiot Excallaber (PEX) database and has been sanitized prior to inclusion in this study.

HOS is an excel spreadsheet with an accompanying PowerPoint presentation.
